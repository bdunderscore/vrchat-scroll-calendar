# Overview

This asset displays data from the [VRChat event calendar][10] operated by Cuckoo (@nest_cuckoo) within a VRChat world.
It supports scrolling through the displayed events to deal with cases where the event list overflows the display.

# Usage

1. Ensure that there is an Event System component in your scene. If not, create a UI canvas, then delete it. An Event System component will be automatically added.
2. Place either the StdCalendar or UnlitCalendar prefab in the scene, and adjust the position and
scale as desired. Please avoid adjusting the aspect ratio of the prefab.。

StdCalendar is based on the Unity Standard shader, and is therefore influenced by world shadows and lighting.
The appearance can be adjusted by editing the CalendarMatStd material.
Avoid changing the albedo, or the tiling and offset settings in the main maps section.

UnlitCalendar is based on an unlit shader, and may be easier to use in worlds that make use of unlit shaders.
The brightness can be adjusted a bit in the CalendarMat material.

Note: When placed near the floor near spawn, there are cases where it may not be possible to drag the
scrollbar to the bottom of the display. It is recommended to place it at least a meter or so from
spawn.

## Brightness adjustment

The UnlitCalendar asset, as well as the scrollbar elements on the StdCalendar asset, use unlit shaders
and therefore aren't influenced by world lighting and shadows. If brightness adjustment is required, please
adjust the following values.

1. The Brightness value in the CalendarMat material (if using UnlitCalendar)
2. The Normal color setting on the Scrollbar object within the prefab
3. The Color setting on the Handle object within the prefab
